# 🛡️ Nemesis Anti-Cheat

Nemesis is a simple example of an anti-cheat system. The goal of the project is to demonstrate the basic principles of building a cheat protection system for gaming applications.

## 🌟 Features

- **Modular system**: Cheat checks are divided into small, independent modules, allowing for flexible configuration of the system based on player behavior.
- **Standardization**: All modules follow a uniform standard, ensuring consistency and facilitating the development and integration of new modules.
- **Precise detection**: Nemesis focuses on accurate cheat detection, avoiding heuristics and false positives.
- **Simplicity and clarity**: The system is designed to be as simple and understandable as possible, demonstrating the basic principles of how an anti-cheat works.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `/sdk` - SDK for developing check modules
- `/bootstrap` - System loader and initializer
- `/testapp` - Test application to demonstrate Nemesis capabilities
